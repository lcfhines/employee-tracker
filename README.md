## Description

This command-line application can be used to manage a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL.

The application allows the user to view and edit information about the company's departments, roles, and employees. 

This project introduces MySQL via creating, adding to and editing tables in the schema. The project also incorporates JOINs to relate data from one table to another.

```

## Installation

To install the application, Node.js, Inquirer, MySQL and console.table all need to be installed.  

## Usage

In order to connect to the database, you need to create the database in MySQL first by executing schema.sql and seeds.sql.  

In index.js, input MySQL username and password in the mysql.createConnection to properly connect.  

Run node index to initiate the employee database and select an option. Answer prompts accordingly to add or edit information in the database.
